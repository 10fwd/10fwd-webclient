We are a close-knit and passionate community of individuals who share a common interest in open source software and open source data. United by our dedication to leveraging technology for the betterment of society, we joined forces following the devastating [February 2023 earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Turkey%E2%80%93Syria_earthquake) in Turkey.

In the aftermath of the earthquake, we recognized the pressing need to support those affected and assist in the process of reuniting families and loved ones. With this purpose in mind, we set out to develop innovative tools and solutions aimed at facilitating the search and connection between individuals.

Through tireless collaboration and a collective effort, our community has grown to an inspiring size of 24,000 individuals. Together, we continue to refine and expand our tools, harnessing the power of technology to help reunite families, restore hope, and bring solace to those impacted by the earthquake.

As we forge ahead, our commitment remains unwavering. We strive to enhance our tools, actively contribute to open source projects, and foster a supportive environment where knowledge sharing and collaboration thrive. We are proud to be a part of the open source community and look forward to continuing our journey with you.
